```{r setup, include=FALSE}
knitr::opts_chunk$set(echo = FALSE)
```

# This is a title slide

## Revisiting the working directory problem

> - clone [this repo](https://github.com/ttimbers/equine_numbers_value_canada_simple)
> - let's use this to demonstrate the working directory problem

## Lecture learning goals:

### By the end of this week, you should be able to:
- Use RStudio to create, edit and run an Rscript 
- Use RStudio to access the help files
- **Use RStudio to edit, create and run R Markdown documents (for reports and presentations)**
- **Use Jupyter to make presenations using RISE**

# Back to presentations

## Presentations with ioslides in R Markdown

We will use this resource: https://rmarkdown.rstudio.com/ioslides_presentation_format

# Title Slide

## Slide with Bullets

- Bullet 1
- Bullet 2
- Bullet 3

## Slide with R Output

This is some code
```{r code demo, echo = TRUE}
x <- 5
y <- 10
(x <- x + y)
```
That's all folks!

## Slide with R Output where code has an intentional error

This is some code that has an error.

```{r error demo, echo = TRUE, error = TRUE}
x <- 5
y <- M
(x <- x + y)
```

Our `.Rmd` will still knit because we used the code chunk option `error = TRUE`

## Slide with Plot

```{r pressure}
plot(pressure)
```

There should be no header here


## Presentations with RISE in Jupyter

- Another way to do reproducible presentations
- In Jupyter, instead of R Markdown
- Pro: can run/execute code from presentation mode!
- Con: faces same version control issues as a regular Jupyter notebook; Not yet in Jupyter lab.

## Installing RISE

- Install RISE using `conda`: `conda install -c damianavila82 rise` at the command line

- Using pip: `pip install RISE`

- Then, run `jupyter-nbextension install rise --py --sys-prefix`

- Finally, `jupyter-nbextension enable rise --py --sys-prefix`

## Getting started with RISE in Jupyter

- Open Jupyter and create a new notebook. To be able to access slide options, from the "View" menu, select "Cell Toolbar" > "Slideshow". Now you should have a drop-down menu for each cell that lets you identify it as a slide (or whatever is appropriate).
- To view your presentation, click on the Enter/Exit RISE Slideshow button, it looks like this:
