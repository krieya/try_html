## Course Learning Outcomes

By the end of the course, students are expected to:
1. Use the Unix command line to navigate their computer's filesystem.
2. Define and distinguish between absolute file paths and relative file paths.
3. Effectively use local and remote version control software (e.g., Git and GitHub) to organize projects and manage file versions.
4. Create, edit and run reproducible literate Python and R code documents (e.g., reports and presentations) using Jupyter and RMarkdown. 
5. Write and edit Markdown and in-line LaTeX syntax within literate code documents. 
6. Define and correctly use a project working directory.
7. Diagnose and troubleshoot programming and development environment problems, and explain how such problems can be avoided.
8. Write regular expressions for pattern matching.
9. Set and get environment variables;
